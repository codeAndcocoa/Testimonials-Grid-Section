                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                  at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                  themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their

                  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                  learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                  former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                  the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                  They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                  assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                  outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                  no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it
                  during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                  certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                  receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
